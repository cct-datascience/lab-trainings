### Homework:

Before this meeting, everyone should bring a script (along with any data or files needed to make it work) that they can share for reviewâ€”it doesn't have to be related to your research.
If someone doesn't have a script to share (e.g. a new lab member), they can use one of the example scripts we've provided.
The point is to practice the process of peer code review, so it doesn't really matter what the code is!

## What is peer code review?

Peer code review is the practice of reviewing a team member's computer code for potential problems.
It's used commonly in the software industry and has been adapted as a teaching tool in many computer science courses [@hundhausen2009; @song2020].
Since writing computer code has become a ubiquitous part of many fields outside of computer science, it makes sense to adapt this practice.
This module focuses on developing some lab policies and procedures around peer code review and will give you an opportunity to practice!

## Why practice peer code review?

## Discussion

Take a moment to think, then discucss:

Do you ever feel reluctant to share your code?
That's ok!
Sharing code can make us feel vulnerable in many ways.
What are some concerns you have about sharing your code with the world?
:::

Along with the rise in code being used in many areas of science, there is a so-called "reproducibility crisis" where the results of many studies cannot be reproduced from the code that is provided.
Errors in code or problems with reproducibility can result in incorrect conclusions and potentially corrections or even retractions in published works.
One reason to practice peer code review is to hopefully catch any issues early on to save wasted time.
Another major benefit of peer code review is the opportunity to learn from eachother.
Many of us are self-taught coders and we pick up tips and tricks from various sources that save us time and allow us to write better code.
Peer code review is a great way to open up conversations about these tips and to learn ways to make our lives easier when it comes to coding.

## How to do peer code review?

Things to consider:

-   Consider that this is a scary process for many.
    Sharing code is a vulnerable act, treat people with kindness.

-   How much time to spend

-   In the same room or as "homework"?

-   how to share code (email vs. thumb drive, vs. GitHub)

-   How to conduct review <!--# get inspiration from reprohack website for this section -->

    -   with kindness

    -   on a different computer from the one where the code was written

    -   use rubric as guide for what to look for

-   How to share review

-   How to receive review

### Rubric

Here's a rubric I created that could be used during peer code review in a life sciences research group.

A score of 4 is exceptional while 1 is unsatisfactory and in need of improvement.

|                           | 4                                                                                                                                                                              | 3                                                                                                                               | 2                                                                                                                       | 1                                                                        |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| Reproducibility           | Unmodified code runs on another machine without error.                                                                                                                         | Code must me minimally modified to run without error. Necessary modifications documented.                                       | Code must be modified in multiple places or ways to run without error. Necessary modifications are not well documented. | Very difficult or impossible to reproduce analysis.                      |
| Code Readability          | Code is formatted with human readability in mind. Variable and function names are concise, descriptive, and unambiguous. Follows a consistent style that improves readability. | Code is human readable, but could be improved. Variable or function names could be improved. Styling of code could be improved. | Readability of code could be improved in more than one way.                                                             | Format of code impedes readability.                                      |
| Documentation             | Code is understandable from documentation and comments alone.                                                                                                                  | Most complex code and functions are documented properly.                                                                        | There are some comments, but major portions of code are left uncommented                                                | Essentially no comments or documentation                                 |
| Correctness / reusability | Analysis produces correct results, even with modified or updated data.                                                                                                         | Minor changes are needed to produce correct results when data are modified or updated.                                          | Code is of limited reusability and must be heavily edited to apply to modified or updated data.                         | Mistakes in the analysis result in incorrect results with original data. |

## Exercise

Partner up with a peer code reviewer!
Share your prepared scripts with eachother and also *briefly* share with eachother what you hope to get out of the review.

If time permits (min 20 minutes), get started on the peer review.
As questions about the process come up, feel free to raise your hand and interrupt the group to discuss.
The point here is not to complete a full review of your partner's code, but to work out any kinks in the process of doing a code review!

## When to do peer code review?

::: callout-note
## Discussion

-   At what point in a project would this be useful?

-   In what venue should this be done?
    E.g. at a lab meeting, at a special peer code review "club", individually scheduled events.
